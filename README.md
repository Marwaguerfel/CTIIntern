# CTIIntern

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my work as a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) intern. It contains code, custom datasets, and project files related to my CTI research, focusing on CTI benchmarking, threat intelligence, and experimentation with AI models.

### Directory Structure

- **MCQ/**: Contains files and code related to multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for CTI evaluation. This includes datasets, scripts for generating custom datasets, and code for fine-tuning CTI-related MCQs.

- **RCM/**: Contains evaluations of the paper dataset, the construction of my custom dataset, and their evaluations.

- **VSP/**: Similar to RCM, this folder contains evaluations of the paper dataset, the construction of my custom dataset, and their evaluations.

- **cti-bench-main/**: The main CTI benchmark folder, which includes primary benchmark datasets, evaluation scripts, and configuration files to assess CTI models.

- **LLM-threat-intelligence-Paper.pdf**: A research paper on using large language models (LLMs) for threat intelligence, covering theoretical background and practical applications of AI in CTI.

### Models Used

This project leverages several advanced large language models for CTI-related tasks:

- **LLaMA 3.1 Quantized**: A version of the LLaMA model optimized for limited computational resources through quantization. It is fine-tuned for cybersecurity question-answering and threat analysis, making it well-suited for CTI.

- **Llama3.1, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 o, and Gemini**: Employed for benchmarking and experimentation in generating and evaluating custom CTI datasets.
